README for the debian-mendix-archive-keyring package
====================================================

The debian mendix archive digitally signs its Release files that are stored on
the packages.mendix.com http server with the keys contained in this package.

Each active key is provided in a separate keyring in /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/
as conffiles.

More information about the archive authentication feature can be found
here: http://wiki.debian.org/SecureApt
